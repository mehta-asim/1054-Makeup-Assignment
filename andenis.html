			<p> My favourite sports are football (soccer) and baskteball. My favourite sports teams are the Los Angeles Lakers in the NBA and the Chelsea FC in the EPL. I also like cricket, usually T-20 but I will watch just about any sport. I love sports!.</p>

<h2>Home</h2>
<p> I am from Jamaica. It is a small English speaking island in the Caribbean. While we speak English, Patois is the language that is commonly spoken. Patois is a mixture of English, Spanish, French and Afriacn words spoken together. Jamaica is home to reggae icon, Bob Marley and the fastest man in the world, Usain Bolt.</p>

		<h2>Work</h2>
		<p> Most of my current work is in Facilities Management. I enjoy it a lot as I get to spend most of my day being involved in sports and attending sporting events. Additionally, I am a Justice of the Peace. As such, I am involved in a lot of civic duties and I work with a lot of young males where I do mentorship and program management. I find working with young men to be rewarding. I am also the Founder of a Not for Profit organization that is geared specifically towards working with males in youth development.</p>

		<h2> Hobbies</h2>
		<p> My hobbies include:</p>

		<ul>
			<li>Reading</li>
			<li>Playing football and basketball</li>
			<li>Gardening</li>
		</ul>

		<p> Below are images of some of the flowers I have planted in my garden:</p>
